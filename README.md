- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Mathew-G020465
I'm creating this project to put together various sources of arch linux installation to create a laptop version that will be for general use with a high enough degree of security that I can use it on the road (in coffee shops, hotels, waiting rooms etc.) without the fear of being exploited or compromised.
